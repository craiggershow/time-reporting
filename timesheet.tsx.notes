Here is an explanation of how the functions within the `timesheet.tsx` file relate and their sequence:

1. **Component Setup and Initialization:**
   - `TimesheetScreen`: The main functional component that sets up state, context, and other hooks. It initializes the timesheet screen and handles various user interactions.

2. **Fetching and Processing Data:**
   - `useEffect` (fetchTimesheet): This `useEffect` hook is responsible for fetching the current timesheet data from the backend when the component mounts. It processes the data and updates the state accordingly.

3. **State Management and Updates:**
   - `handleTimeUpdate`: Updates the time entry for a specific day and week. It calculates the total hours and dispatches the updated entry to the state.
   - `handleDayTypeChange`: Updates the day type for a specific day and week.
   - `handleExtraHoursChange`: Updates the extra hours for a specific week.
   - `handleVacationHoursChange`: Updates the vacation hours in the state.

4. **Auto-submit and Validation:**
   - `autoSubmit`: Automatically submits the timesheet data after a set timeout if there are complete time pairs.
   - `hasValidationErrors` and `getValidationErrors`: Check for validation errors in the timesheet data.

5. **Submission and Recall:**
   - `handleSubmit`: Handles the manual submission of the timesheet. It performs validation and submits the data to the backend.
   - `handleRecall`: Placeholder function for recalling a previous submission (implementation TODO).

6. **Helper Functions:**
   - `calculateWeekTotal`: Calculates the total hours for a given week.
   - `processWeekData`: Processes the raw week data from the backend into a structured format.

**Sequence:**
1. Component mounts and `fetchTimesheet` is called to load data.
2. User interacts with the timesheet (e.g., updates time entries, changes day types).
3. `handleTimeUpdate`, `handleDayTypeChange`, `handleExtraHoursChange`, and `handleVacationHoursChange` update the state with new values.
4. If there are unsaved changes, `autoSubmit` is triggered after a timeout to submit the data.
5. User can manually submit the timesheet using `handleSubmit`, which validates and sends the data to the backend.
6. Helper functions assist in data processing and calculation throughout the component lifecycle.


The `handle` functions within the `TimesheetScreen` component are called as follows:

1. **`handleTimeUpdate`**:
   - Called within the `WeekTable` component for each week.
   - Example: `onUpdate={(day, field, value) => handleTimeUpdate(1, day, field, value)}` for week 1 and similarly for week 2.

2. **`handleDayTypeChange`**:
   - Called within the `WeekTable` component for each week to handle changes in the day type.
   - Example: `onDayTypeChange={(day, type) => handleDayTypeChange(1, day, type)}` for week 1 and similarly for week 2.

3. **`handleExtraHoursChange`**:
   - Called within the `WeekTable` component for each week to handle changes in extra hours.
   - Example: `onExtraHoursChange={(hours) => handleExtraHoursChange(1, hours)}` for week 1 and similarly for week 2.

4. **`handleVacationHoursChange`**:
   - Called within the `Input` component for vacation hours input.
   - Example: `<Input value={vacationHours} onChangeText={handleVacationHoursChange} />`.

These functions are used to update the state with the new values provided by the user interactions in the UI components.


The TimesheetScreen function is a React component that manages the timesheet UI for recording and submitting work hours. It performs the following tasks:

Initializes state and context hooks (useTimesheet, useTheme, useAuth).
Fetches timesheet data from the backend when the component mounts (fetchTimesheet).
Handles user interactions such as updating time entries (handleTimeUpdate), changing day types (handleDayTypeChange), updating extra hours (handleExtraHoursChange), and updating vacation hours (handleVacationHoursChange).
Automatically submits the timesheet if there are complete time pairs (autoSubmit).
Manages form submission with validation (handleSubmit).
Provides UI for copying week data (handleCopyWeek), copying previous day's data (handleCopyPrevious), and recalling previous submissions (handleRecall).
How it's Called:
The TimesheetScreen component is likely rendered as part of the application's routing mechanism.
It is called when the user navigates to the timesheet page within the application.
