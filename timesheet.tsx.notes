Here is an explanation of how the functions within the `timesheet.tsx` file relate and their sequence:

1. **Component Setup and Initialization:**
   - `TimesheetScreen`: The main functional component that sets up state, context, and other hooks. It initializes the timesheet screen and handles various user interactions.

2. **Fetching and Processing Data:**
   - `useEffect` (fetchTimesheet): This `useEffect` hook is responsible for fetching the current timesheet data from the backend when the component mounts. It processes the data and updates the state accordingly.

3. **State Management and Updates:**
   - `handleTimeUpdate`: Updates the time entry for a specific day and week. It calculates the total hours and dispatches the updated entry to the state.
   - `handleDayTypeChange`: Updates the day type for a specific day and week.
   - `handleExtraHoursChange`: Updates the extra hours for a specific week.
   - `handleVacationHoursChange`: Updates the vacation hours in the state.

4. **Auto-submit and Validation:**
   - `autoSubmit`: Automatically submits the timesheet data after a set timeout if there are complete time pairs.
   - `hasValidationErrors` and `getValidationErrors`: Check for validation errors in the timesheet data.

5. **Submission and Recall:**
   - `handleSubmit`: Handles the manual submission of the timesheet. It performs validation and submits the data to the backend.
   - `handleRecall`: Placeholder function for recalling a previous submission (implementation TODO).

6. **Helper Functions:**
   - `calculateWeekTotal`: Calculates the total hours for a given week.
   - `processWeekData`: Processes the raw week data from the backend into a structured format.

**Sequence:**
1. Component mounts and `fetchTimesheet` is called to load data.
2. User interacts with the timesheet (e.g., updates time entries, changes day types).
3. `handleTimeUpdate`, `handleDayTypeChange`, `handleExtraHoursChange`, and `handleVacationHoursChange` update the state with new values.
4. If there are unsaved changes, `autoSubmit` is triggered after a timeout to submit the data.
5. User can manually submit the timesheet using `handleSubmit`, which validates and sends the data to the backend.
6. Helper functions assist in data processing and calculation throughout the component lifecycle.


The `handle` functions within the `TimesheetScreen` component are called as follows:

1. **`handleTimeUpdate`**:
   - Called within the `WeekTable` component for each week.
   - Example: `onUpdate={(day, field, value) => handleTimeUpdate(1, day, field, value)}` for week 1 and similarly for week 2.

2. **`handleDayTypeChange`**:
   - Called within the `WeekTable` component for each week to handle changes in the day type.
   - Example: `onDayTypeChange={(day, type) => handleDayTypeChange(1, day, type)}` for week 1 and similarly for week 2.

3. **`handleExtraHoursChange`**:
   - Called within the `WeekTable` component for each week to handle changes in extra hours.
   - Example: `onExtraHoursChange={(hours) => handleExtraHoursChange(1, hours)}` for week 1 and similarly for week 2.

4. **`handleVacationHoursChange`**:
   - Called within the `Input` component for vacation hours input.
   - Example: `<Input value={vacationHours} onChangeText={handleVacationHoursChange} />`.

These functions are used to update the state with the new values provided by the user interactions in the UI components.
